I'm very sorry for my code. But I can do
this only because there was no time. I hope the next
code will be better.
And now about this application.
It's a game. You start with one ball and it is 'running' on the field.
When the ball touches walls it changes its direction.
You can move the ball with the mouse. The Ball will be wherever you are clicking.
On the playing field 3 buttons are located:
1) "Pause" -- pausing game but "mousemoving" isn't pausing
2) "Rating" -- shows last 10 plays (name : seconds)
3) "Add ball" -- the next chapter describes it.
When clicking the button "Add ball", the real game is starting.
The new ball you should control with "WASD".
When the first ball is touching the new one the game is finishing.
You should enter your name and your results turn out to be in the rating table.
Then you can see the rating by pressing the button "Rating"
Note: the real time starts when pressing "Add ball"
Then you can only close the game and start it again.
                    Have fun!
