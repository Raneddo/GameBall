I'm very sorry for my code. But I can do only 
this because there was no time. I hope, that next
code will be better.
And now about this program.
It's game. You start with one ball and it 'run' on field.
When ball concerns walls it changes self direction.
You can move ball with mouse. The Ball will be where you click.
On playing field are located 3 buttons:
1) "Pause" -- pausing game, but "mousemoving" isn't pausing
2) "Rating" -- show last 10 plays (name : seconds)
3) "Add ball" -- about it next chapter.
When you click to button "Add ball", real game is starting.
You should control new ball with "WASD".
When first ball concerns new, game is finishing.
You shold your name, and you results turn out to be in rating table.
Then you can see rating with pressing button "Rating"
Note, real time starts when do you press "Add ball"
Then you can only close the game and start again.
                    Have fun!
